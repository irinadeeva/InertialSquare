# Inertial Square Task

This project demonstrates the implementation of an interactive square view in a Swift-based application that moves and behaves with physical properties when tapped.

## Overview

The main goal of this project is to create a blue square that animates to a tapped location on the screen with the following features:

- **Animated Movement**: When the screen is tapped, the squareâ€™s center moves to the tapped point with a smooth animation.
- **Physics-Inspired Motion**: The square moves like a physical object, including:
  - **Inertia**: If the square travels a long distance, it overshoots the target with a bouncing effect.
  - **Rotation**: The square slightly rotates during its motion, adding to the dynamic visual effect.
